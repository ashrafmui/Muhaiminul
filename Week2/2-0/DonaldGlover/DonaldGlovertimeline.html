                on December 2, 2016,[5] by Glassnote Records.[6] Consisting of tracks being sung rather than rapped, its
                fusion of psychedelic soul, funk and R&B influences was considered a bold departure from the predominately
                hip hop style of his prior work.[7][4] The album was produced by Glover and his longtime collaborator, Ludwig
                Göransson. "Awaken, My Love!" received generally positive reviews from critics and debuted at number five
                on the US Billboard 200. It also debuted at number two on the US Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. The album
                was supported by two singles, "Me and Your Mama" and "Redbone".</p>
